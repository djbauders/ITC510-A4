Assignment 4 (20 pts) - Due: 9/23/22 (10pm):
Group Members:
In this assignment, you will be using pandas to load in a dataset of flight delays for January 2019 and perform an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the data.
The data (.csv file) and the metadata column descriptions(.txt) file are located on BlackBoard with this assignment.
Use a Jupyter notebook to create a report that answers the following questions and creates a few plots about this data.
Your report should not only answer these questions but also the code you implemented to perform your analysis.
Note that these questions are not separate problems but rather items you can address in any order you choose.Â¶
* What is the median number of flights from all airports?
* Which are the 5 busiest airports? Which are the last busiest airports
* What percentages of flights from all airports are on-time?
* Which airlines are better than the average? Which airlines are worse than the average?
* What airports are better than the average? Which airports are worse than the average?
* Which feature (column) in the data set is most correlated with departure delays?
* Make a histogram plot visualizing the number of flights for the 5 best on-time airports.
* Make a scatter plot of the departure delays and the feature most correlated with the delays
Extra Credit (5 points)
Perform another exploratory analysis with the data and add this to the report. Be sure to emphasis in your report that this is something you chose to do on your own. Be creative and document your findings. Try to come up with something unique that someone else wouldn't think of.
